# MuteBwonsamdi
World of Warcraft retail addon to mute Bwonsamdi's dialog if you die in Zandalar

Uses APIs added in WoW 8.2 and will not work in earlier versions.

Known issues: 

* Bwonsamdi uses special voice lines when your armor durability gets below a certain point, but I haven't located these sound files to block them
